To start, we introduce some terminology and preliminary facts. \n\n\n**Definition**: Let $X$ be a topological space. A decomposition of $X$ is a partition of $X$ into compact subsets $\\{C_\\alpha\\}$. The decomposition $\\{C_\\alpha\\}$ is upper semi-continuous if whenever a decomposition element $C_\\alpha$ is contained in an open set $U,$ there exists another open set $V\\subset U$ which also contains $C_\\alpha$ and has the property that for any other $C_\\beta,$ if $C_\\beta\\cap V\\neq \\emptyset$ then $C_\\beta\\subset V.$\n\nThe condition to be a USC-decomposition looks a bit strange at first, but we shall see that it is exceedingly convenient and also not too difficult to satisfy in practice. \n\nFor $X$ a topological space and $\\mathcal{D} = \\{C_\\alpha\\}$ an upper semi-continuous decomposition, we write $X/\\mathcal{D}$ for the quotient space where each decomposition element $C_\\alpha\\in \\mathcal{D}$ is collapsed to a point. As we will see, the condition that $\\mathcal{D}$ is upper semi-continuous is equivalent to $X/\\mathcal{D}$ being Hausdorff.\n\n**Lemma**: Let $X$ be a topological space, $\\{C_\\alpha\\}$ an upper semi-continuous decomposition, and $U\\subset X$ an open set. Then, the union of all the decomposition elements contained in $U$ is an open set. \n\n*Proof*: Let $I = \\{\\alpha \\mid C_\\alpha\\subset U\\}$ and let $V = \\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in I}C_\\alpha.$ Let $x\\in V$ be arbitrary. Then, there is some $C_\\alpha$ such that $x\\in C_\\alpha\\subset U.$ Because the decomposition $\\{C_\\alpha\\}$ is USC, there exists an open set $U'\\subset U$ such that $x\\in C_\\alpha\\subset U'\\subset U$ and if $C_\\beta\\cap U'\\neq \\emptyset$ then $C_\\beta\\subset U'.$ Let $y\\in U'.$ Since $\\{C_\\alpha\\}$ is a partition of $X$, there is a unique $C_\\beta$ containing $y.$ In particular, this means that $C_\\beta\\cap U'$ is non-empty so $C_\\beta\\subset U'\\subset U,$ i.e. $y\\in V.$ Therefore, $U'\\subset V$ is open and contains $x.$ Since $x\\in V$ was arbitary, $V$ is an open set. \n\nNotice that the converse of this Lemma is also true by a very straightforward argument coming from the definition of upper semi-continuity. \n\n**Theorem**: Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space and let $\\mathcal{D}=\\{C_\\alpha\\}$ be an upper semi-continuous decomposition of $X$. Then, the quotient space $X/\\mathcal{D}$ is also a compact Hausdorff space. \n\n*Proof*: The quotient space $X/\\mathcal{D}$ is automatically compact since the quotient map $p:X\\to X/\\mathcal{D}$ is surjective and continuous. Let $C_\\alpha,C_\\beta\\in X/\\mathcal{D}.$ Because $X$ is Hausdorff and $C_\\alpha,C_\\beta\\subset X$ are compact, they are also closed. Since $X$ is both compact and Hausdorff, it is also normal so there exists disjoint open sets $U_\\alpha,V_\\alpha \\subset X$ such that $C_\\alpha\\subset U$ and $C_\\beta\\subset V.$ Let $V_\\alpha$ be the union of all of the decomposition elements contained in $U_\\alpha$ and let $V_\\beta$ be the union of all the decomposition elements contained in $U_\\beta.$ The sets $V_\\alpha,V_\\beta$ are both open by the above lemma. Moreover, $p(V_\\alpha)$ and $p(V_\\beta)$ are open in $X/\\mathcal{D}$ (because of how $V_\\alpha,V_\\beta$ were constructed) and are disjoint. Thus, $X/\\mathcal{D}$ is Hausdorff as desired. \n\n**Corollary 1**: For $X$ a compact Hausdorff space and $\\mathcal{D} = \\{C_\\alpha\\}$ a decomposition of $X$, $\\mathcal{D}$ is USC if and only if $X/\\mathcal{D}$ is Hausdorff. \n\n*Proof*: One direction is exactly the theorem we have just proven, so we just need to show that if $X/\\mathcal{D}$ is Hausdorff, then $\\mathcal{D}$ is USC. Suppose that $X/\\mathcal{D}$ is Hausdorff. Since $X$ is compact Hausdorff and $X/\\mathcal{D}$ is Hausdorff, the quotient map $p:X\\to X/\\mathcal{D}$ is a closed map. Let $U\\subset X$ be open such that $U$ contains at least one decomposition element. Let $V$ be the union of all decomposition elements contained in the open set $U.$ Then, $p(V)$ is the complement of $p(X\\setminus U)$ so $p(V)$ is open in $X/\\mathcal{D}.$ Moreover, $V$ is a union of decomposition elements so $p^{-1}(p(V))=V$, i.e. $V$ is also open in $X$. Thus, $\\mathcal{D}$ is USC. \n\n**Corollary 2**: Let $f:X\\to Y$ be a surjective continuous map of compact Hausdorff spaces. Then, $\\{f^{-1}(y)\\mid y\\in Y\\}$ is a USC decomposition of $X$. \n\n*Proof*: Since $X,Y$ are compact Hausdorff, $f$ is a quotient map and every fiber is compact. Moreovoer, $Y$ being Hausdorff means we can apply Corollary 1 to get that $\\{f^{-1}(y)\\mid y\\in Y\\}$ is USC. \n\nBefore tackling the main theorem, we need one more key lemma about USC decompositions which will do most of the work for us in proving the main theorem. \n\n**Key Lemma**: Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space and let $\\mathcal{D}=\\{C_\\alpha\\}$ be a USC decomposition of $X.$ Let $\\mathcal{D}'$ be the decomposition whose elements are the connected components of the elements of $\\mathcal{D}.$ Then, $\\mathcal{D}'$ is also USC. \n\n*Proof*: Let $C_\\alpha'\\in \\mathcal{D}'$ be a connected component of some $C_\\alpha\\in \\mathcal{D}$ and suppose that $C_\\alpha'\\subset U$ for some open $U\\subset X.$ Because $C_\\alpha$ is compact and Hausdorff, there exists a set $D$ which is clopen in $C_\\alpha$ such that $C_\\alpha'\\subset D\\subset (U\\cap C_\\alpha).$ The set $D$ is open in $C_\\alpha$ so there exists an open $U_D\\subset X$ such that $D = U_D\\cap C_\\alpha.$ Moreover, $D$ is contained in $U$ so we can assume that $U_D\\subset U$ (if not just intersect them). Because $D$ is clopen in $C_\\alpha,$ $D = \\overline{U_D}\\cap C_\\alpha$ as well. In particular, this means that $(\\overline{U_D}\\setminus U_D)\\cap C_\\alpha = \\emptyset.$ Define $U^* = U_D\\cup (X\\setminus \\overline{U_D})$ and note that $U^*$ is a disjoint union of two open sets and it contains $C_\\alpha.$ Let $V$ be the union of all the elements in $\\mathcal{D}$ which are contained in $U^*.$ Since $\\mathcal{D}$ is USC, $V$ is open in $X$. Let $V'=V\\cap U_D$ so $V'$ is open and contains $C_\\alpha'.$ Suppose that $C_\\beta'$ is a component of some $C_\\beta\\in \\mathcal{D}$ such that $C_\\beta$ intersects $V'$ non-trivially. By construction, $C_\\beta$ must be contained within $V.$ Moreover, $C_\\beta'$ is connected and intersects with $U_D$ so $C_\\beta'$ must be contained in $U_D.$ Thus, $C_\\beta'\\subset V'\\subset U_D\\subset U.$ The open set $V'$ therefore demonstrates that $\\mathcal{D}'$ is USC. \n\n**Definition**: A continuous map $f:X\\to Y$ is monotone if all of its fibers are connected. \n\n**Definition**: A continuous map $f:X\\to Y$ is light if all of its fibers are totally disconnected. \n\nWe now have all of the ingredients we need to state and prove the Monotone-Light Factorization theorem: \n\n**Theorem (Monotone-Light Factorization)**: Let $f:X\\to Y$ be a continuous mapping of compact Hausdorff spaces. Then, there exists a third compact Hausdorff space $Z$ and continuous maps $m:X\\to Z$ and $l:Z\\to Y$ such that $f = l\\circ m$, $m$ is monotone, and $l$ is light. \n\n*Proof*: Let $\\mathcal{D}$ be the decomposition of $X$ given by the connected components of the fibers of $f.$ Corollary 2 and our Key Lemma guarantee that this is a USC decomposition of $X$. Let $Z$ be the quotient space $X/\\mathcal{D}$ and let $m:X\\to Z$ be the quotient map. The space $Z$ is compact Hausdorff by our previous theorem and $m$ is monotone by construction. There is a natural map $l:Z\\to Y$ which just takes a component of the fiber $f^{-1}(y)$ to the point $y.$ The map $l$ is light because the collection of components of a fiber $f^{-1}(y)$ will be totally disconnected in the quotient space $Z = X/\\mathcal{D}.$\n\n**References**:\n\nDanny Calegari's Point Set-Topology Course at UChicago Winter 2023. \n\nDecompositions of Manifolds by Robert J.

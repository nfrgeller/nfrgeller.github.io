    "text": "In this note I want to review the Cayley-Hamilton theorem for fields and explain how it easily generalizes to the setting of commutative rings. I will then use this more general form of the theorem to prove Nakayama’s lemma.\nTheorem 1: Let \\(k\\) be a field and let \\(A\\in k^{n\\times n}\\) be a square matrix with entries in \\(k\\). Let \\(p\\in k[t]\\) be the characteristic polynomial of \\(A\\), i.e. \\(p(t) = \\text{det}(t\\text{Id}-A)\\). Then, \\(p(A)=0\\).\nProof: Since every field is contained in its algebraic closure, we can assume without loss of generality that \\(k\\) is algebraically closed. Define a map \\(\\varphi:k^{n\\times n}\\to k\\) which takes a square matrix and evaluates it on its own characteristic polynomial. Because the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix are themselves polynomials in the entries of the matrix, \\(\\varphi\\) will be a (very complicated) polynomial function \\(k^{n\\times n}\\to k\\). In particular, the set of matrices which satisfy their own characteristic polynomial is a Zariski closed subset of the affine space \\(k^{n\\times n}\\). It thus suffices to show that the theorem holds on a Zariski dense subset of matrices.\nDefine \\(\\psi:k^n\\to k\\) to be the map which takes a square matrix to the discriminant of its characteristic polynomial. The map \\(\\psi\\) is a polynomial map because the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are polynomials in the matrix entries. Because we are working over an algebraically closed field, the non-vanishing set \\(D(\\psi) = \\{A\\in k^{n\\times n}\\mid \\psi(A)\\neq 0\\}\\) is exactly the set of square matrices whose characteristic polynomial has no repeated roots. Every such matrix will have all distinct eigenvalues and will thus be diagonalizable. The subset \\(D(\\psi)\\subset k^{n\\times n}\\) is therefore non-empty and Zariski open, so it is Zariski dense. Since every eigenvalue of a matrix is a root of its characteristic polynomial, \\(\\varphi(A)=0\\) for all \\(A\\in D(\\psi)\\). Because \\(D(\\psi)\\) is Zariski dense and \\(\\varphi\\) is a polynomial, it follows that \\(\\varphi(A)=0\\) for all matrices \\(A\\in k^{n\\times n}\\), i.e. every matrix is a zero of its own characteristic polynomial as desired.\nBecause we have shown that the Cayley-Hamilton theorem holds for all fields, it is straightforward to check that it holds for any ring which is contained inside a field. This shows that it holds for all integral domains, since they sit inside their field of fractions. It turns out this is enough to deduce the general result for arbitrary commutative rings, as we can take advantage of the universal property of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) as the initial object in the category of commutative rings.\nTheorem: Let \\(R\\) be a commutative ring and let \\(A\\) be an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix with entries in \\(R\\). Let \\(p_A(t)\\in R[t]\\) be the characteristic polynomial of \\(A,\\) i.e. \\(p_A(t) = \\det(t\\text{Id}-A)\\). Then, \\(p_A(A)=0\\).\nProof: Let \\(S = \\mathbb{Z}[\\{x_{ij}\\}_{i,j=1}^n]\\) be the polynomial ring in \\(n^2\\) variables with integer coefficients. Define \\(\\theta:S\\to R\\) to be the ring homomorphism which sends each indeterminate \\(x_{ij}\\) to the matrix entry \\(A_{ij}\\in R\\). Let \\(X\\) be the matrix of indeterminates, so \\(X_{ij}=x_{ij}\\). Because \\(S\\) is a domain, it embeds into its field of fractions, \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\{x_{ij}\\}_{i,j=1}^n)\\), so \\(p_X(X)=0\\). Because the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix are polynomials in the entries of that matrix, we have that\n\\[p_A(t) = \\theta(s_0)+\\dots +\\theta(s_{n-1})t^{n-1}+t^n\\]\nwhere \\(s_0,\\dots,s_{n-1}\\in S\\) such that\n\\[p_X(t) = s_0+s_1t+\\dots+s_{n-1}t^{n-1}+t^n.\\]\nWe have an induced homomorphism on matrix rings, \\(\\overline{\\theta}:S^{n\\times n}\\to R^{n\\times n}\\), which just applies the map \\(\\theta\\) on each entry. Because the map \\(\\overline{\\theta}\\) is a ring homomorphism, we have that\n\\[p_A(A) = \\theta(s_0)+\\dots+A^n = \\overline{\\theta}(s_0+\\dots+X^n) = \\overline{\\theta}(p_X(X)) = 0\\]\nwhich proves the theorem.\nOne interesting application of this general form of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem is a nice proof of Nakayama’s Lemma.\nTheorem: (Nakayama’s Lemma) Let \\((R,\\mathfrak{m})\\) be a local ring and \\(M\\) a finitely generated \\(R\\)-module such that \\(\\mathfrak{m}M=M\\) (or equivalently \\(M/\\mathfrak{m}M=0\\)). Then, \\(M=0\\).\nProof: Let \\(m_1,\\dots,m_n\\) be generators for \\(M\\). Then, there are coefficients \\(a_{ij}\\in R\\) such that\n\\[m_i = \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}m_j.\\]\nBy assumption, \\(M = \\mathfrak{m}M\\) so we can assume that the coefficients \\(a_{ij}\\) are actually all in the ideal \\(\\mathfrak{m}\\subset R.\\) Let \\(A\\) be the \\(n\\times n\\) square matrix with \\(A_{ij}=a_{ij}\\) and note that the linear map \\(A:R^n\\to R^n\\) is a lift of the identity map, \\(\\text{Id}:M\\to M\\), along the surjective map \\(R^n\\to M\\) induced by our choice of generators. Let\n\\[p_A(t) = a_0+a_1t+\\dots+t^n\\]\nbe the characteristic polynomial of \\(A\\). Since \\(p_A(A)=0\\) in the matrix ring \\(M_n(R)\\), we also have \\(p_A(\\text{Id}_M)=0\\) in the ring \\(\\text{End}_R(M)\\). Therefore,\n\\[(a_0+\\dots+a_{n-1}+1)\\text{Id}=0.\\]\nBecause \\(a_0+\\dots+a_{n-1}\\in \\mathfrak{m}\\) and \\(\\mathfrak{m}\\) is maximal,\n\\[1+a_0+\\dots+a_{n-1}\\notin \\mathfrak{m}.\\]\nWe are working in a local ring, so this implies that \\(1+a_0+\\dots+a_{n-1}\\) is a unit, so \\(\\text{Id}_M:M\\to M\\) must be the zero map. Therefore, \\(M=0\\) as desired.\nSources: https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/05G6 and Akhil Mathew’s Graduate Algebra II course at UChicago (Winter 2024)."

    "text": "We will show that any continuous map \\(f:X\\to Y\\) of compact Hausdorff spaces can be factored into a composition of two maps where one has connected fibers and the other has totally disconnected fibers. To start, we introduce some terminology and preliminary facts.\nDefinition: Let \\(X\\) be a topological space. A decomposition of \\(X\\) is a partition of \\(X\\) into compact subsets \\(\\{C_\\alpha\\}\\). The decomposition \\(\\{C_\\alpha\\}\\) is upper semi-continuous if whenever a decomposition element \\(C_\\alpha\\) is contained in an open set \\(U,\\) there exists another open set \\(V\\subset U\\) which also contains \\(C_\\alpha\\) and has the property that for any other \\(C_\\beta,\\) if \\(C_\\beta\\cap V\\neq \\emptyset\\) then \\(C_\\beta\\subset V.\\)\nThe condition to be a USC-decomposition looks a bit strange at first, but we shall see that it is exceedingly convenient and also not too difficult to satisfy in practice.\nFor \\(X\\) a topological space and \\(\\mathcal{D} = \\{C_\\alpha\\}\\) an upper semi-continuous decomposition, we write \\(X/\\mathcal{D}\\) for the quotient space where each decomposition element \\(C_\\alpha\\in \\mathcal{D}\\) is collapsed to a point. As we will see, the condition that \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is upper semi-continuous is equivalent to \\(X/\\mathcal{D}\\) being Hausdorff.\nLemma: Let \\(X\\) be a topological space, \\(\\{C_\\alpha\\}\\) an upper semi-continuous decomposition, and \\(U\\subset X\\) an open set. Then, the union of all the decomposition elements contained in \\(U\\) is an open set.\nProof: Let \\(I = \\{\\alpha \\mid C_\\alpha\\subset U\\}\\) and let \\(V = \\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in I}C_\\alpha.\\) Let \\(x\\in V\\) be arbitrary. Then, there is some \\(C_\\alpha\\) such that \\(x\\in C_\\alpha\\subset U.\\) Because the decomposition \\(\\{C_\\alpha\\}\\) is USC, there exists an open set \\(U'\\subset U\\) such that \\(x\\in C_\\alpha\\subset U'\\subset U\\) and if \\(C_\\beta\\cap U'\\neq \\emptyset\\) then \\(C_\\beta\\subset U'.\\) Let \\(y\\in U'.\\) Since \\(\\{C_\\alpha\\}\\) is a partition of \\(X\\), there is a unique \\(C_\\beta\\) containing \\(y.\\) In particular, this means that \\(C_\\beta\\cap U'\\) is non-empty so \\(C_\\beta\\subset U'\\subset U,\\) i.e. \\(y\\in V.\\) Therefore, \\(U'\\subset V\\) is open and contains \\(x.\\) Since \\(x\\in V\\) was arbitary, \\(V\\) is an open set.\nNotice that the converse of this Lemma is also true by a very straightforward argument coming from the definition of upper semi-continuity.\nTheorem: Let \\(X\\) be a compact Hausdorff space and let \\(\\mathcal{D}=\\{C_\\alpha\\}\\) be an upper semi-continuous decomposition of \\(X\\). Then, the quotient space \\(X/\\mathcal{D}\\) is also a compact Hausdorff space.\nProof: The quotient space \\(X/\\mathcal{D}\\) is automatically compact since the quotient map \\(p:X\\to X/\\mathcal{D}\\) is surjective and continuous. Let \\(C_\\alpha,C_\\beta\\in X/\\mathcal{D}.\\) Because \\(X\\) is Hausdorff and \\(C_\\alpha,C_\\beta\\subset X\\) are compact, they are also closed. Since \\(X\\) is both compact and Hausdorff, it is also normal so there exists disjoint open sets \\(U_\\alpha,V_\\alpha \\subset X\\) such that \\(C_\\alpha\\subset U\\) and \\(C_\\beta\\subset V.\\) Let \\(V_\\alpha\\) be the union of all of the decomposition elements contained in \\(U_\\alpha\\) and let \\(V_\\beta\\) be the union of all the decomposition elements contained in \\(U_\\beta.\\) The sets \\(V_\\alpha,V_\\beta\\) are both open by the above lemma. Moreover, \\(p(V_\\alpha)\\) and \\(p(V_\\beta)\\) are open in \\(X/\\mathcal{D}\\) (because of how \\(V_\\alpha,V_\\beta\\) were constructed) and are disjoint. Thus, \\(X/\\mathcal{D}\\) is Hausdorff as desired.\nCorollary 1: For \\(X\\) a compact Hausdorff space and \\(\\mathcal{D} = \\{C_\\alpha\\}\\) a decomposition of \\(X\\), \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is USC if and only if \\(X/\\mathcal{D}\\) is Hausdorff.\nProof: One direction is exactly the theorem we have just proven, so we just need to show that if \\(X/\\mathcal{D}\\) is Hausdorff, then \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is USC. Suppose that \\(X/\\mathcal{D}\\) is Hausdorff. Since \\(X\\) is compact Hausdorff and \\(X/\\mathcal{D}\\) is Hausdorff, the quotient map \\(p:X\\to X/\\mathcal{D}\\) is a closed map. Let \\(U\\subset X\\) be open such that \\(U\\) contains at least one decomposition element. Let \\(V\\) be the union of all decomposition elements contained in the open set \\(U.\\) Then, \\(p(V)\\) is the complement of \\(p(X\\setminus U)\\) so \\(p(V)\\) is open in \\(X/\\mathcal{D}.\\) Moreover, \\(V\\) is a union of decomposition elements so \\(p^{-1}(p(V))=V\\), i.e. \\(V\\) is also open in \\(X\\). Thus, \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is USC.\nCorollary 2: Let \\(f:X\\to Y\\) be a surjective continuous map of compact Hausdorff spaces. Then, \\(\\{f^{-1}(y)\\mid y\\in Y\\}\\) is a USC decomposition of \\(X\\).\nProof: Since \\(X,Y\\) are compact Hausdorff, \\(f\\) is a quotient map and every fiber is compact. Moreovoer, \\(Y\\) being Hausdorff means we can apply Corollary 1 to get that \\(\\{f^{-1}(y)\\mid y\\in Y\\}\\) is USC.\nBefore tackling the main theorem, we need one more key lemma about USC decompositions which will do most of the work for us in proving the main theorem.\nKey Lemma: Let \\(X\\) be a compact Hausdorff space and let \\(\\mathcal{D}=\\{C_\\alpha\\}\\) be a USC decomposition of \\(X.\\) Let \\(\\mathcal{D}'\\) be the decomposition whose elements are the connected components of the elements of \\(\\mathcal{D}.\\) Then, \\(\\mathcal{D}'\\) is also USC.\nProof: Let \\(C_\\alpha'\\in \\mathcal{D}'\\) be a connected component of some \\(C_\\alpha\\in \\mathcal{D}\\) and suppose that \\(C_\\alpha'\\subset U\\) for some open \\(U\\subset X.\\) Because \\(C_\\alpha\\) is compact and Hausdorff, there exists a set \\(D\\) which is clopen in \\(C_\\alpha\\) such that \\(C_\\alpha'\\subset D\\subset (U\\cap C_\\alpha).\\) The set \\(D\\) is open in \\(C_\\alpha\\) so there exists an open \\(U_D\\subset X\\) such that \\(D = U_D\\cap C_\\alpha.\\) Moreover, \\(D\\) is contained in \\(U\\) so we can assume that \\(U_D\\subset U\\) (if not just intersect them). Because \\(D\\) is clopen in \\(C_\\alpha,\\) \\(D = \\overline{U_D}\\cap C_\\alpha\\) as well. In particular, this means that \\((\\overline{U_D}\\setminus U_D)\\cap C_\\alpha = \\emptyset.\\) Define \\(U^* = U_D\\cup (X\\setminus \\overline{U_D})\\) and note that \\(U^*\\) is a disjoint union of two open sets and it contains \\(C_\\alpha.\\) Let \\(V\\) be the union of all the elements in \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) which are contained in \\(U^*.\\) Since \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is USC, \\(V\\) is open in \\(X\\). Let \\(V'=V\\cap U_D\\) so \\(V'\\) is open and contains \\(C_\\alpha'.\\) Suppose that \\(C_\\beta'\\) is a component of some \\(C_\\beta\\in \\mathcal{D}\\) such that \\(C_\\beta\\) intersects \\(V'\\) non-trivially. By construction, \\(C_\\beta\\) must be contained within \\(V.\\) Moreover, \\(C_\\beta'\\) is connected and intersects with \\(U_D\\) so \\(C_\\beta'\\) must be contained in \\(U_D.\\) Thus, \\(C_\\beta'\\subset V'\\subset U_D\\subset U.\\) The open set \\(V'\\) therefore demonstrates that \\(\\mathcal{D}'\\) is USC.\nDefinition: A continuous map \\(f:X\\to Y\\) is monotone if all of its fibers are connected.\nDefinition: A continuous map \\(f:X\\to Y\\) is light if all of its fibers are totally disconnected.\nWe now have all of the ingredients we need to state and prove the Monotone-Light Factorization theorem:\nTheorem (Monotone-Light Factorization): Let \\(f:X\\to Y\\) be a continuous mapping of compact Hausdorff spaces. Then, there exists a third compact Hausdorff space \\(Z\\) and continuous maps \\(m:X\\to Z\\) and \\(l:Z\\to Y\\) such that \\(f = l\\circ m\\), \\(m\\) is monotone, and \\(l\\) is light.\nProof: Let \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) be the decomposition of \\(X\\) given by the connected components of the fibers of \\(f.\\) Corollary 2 and our Key Lemma guarantee that this is a USC decomposition of \\(X\\). Let \\(Z\\) be the quotient space \\(X/\\mathcal{D}\\) and let \\(m:X\\to Z\\) be the quotient map. The space \\(Z\\) is compact Hausdorff by our previous theorem and \\(m\\) is monotone by construction. There is a natural map \\(l:Z\\to Y\\) which just takes a component of the fiber \\(f^{-1}(y)\\) to the point \\(y.\\) The map \\(l\\) is light because the collection of components of a fiber \\(f^{-1}(y)\\) will be totally disconnected in the quotient space \\(Z = X/\\mathcal{D}.\\)\nReferences:\nDanny Calegari’s Point Set-Topology Course at UChicago Winter 2023.\nDecompositions of Manifolds by Robert J.

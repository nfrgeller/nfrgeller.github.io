I am currently a student in the new research-based Master's in Data Science (MSDS) program at the University of Chicago as part of the UChicago Advanced Scholars Program. I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics at UChicago in 2024. I am primarily interested in the mathematical foundations of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
